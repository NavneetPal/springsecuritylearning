## Overview of Spring Security 6

Spring Security 6 is a robust framework designed to provide comprehensive security features for Java applications, particularly those built with Spring Boot 3. It focuses on **authentication**, **authorization**, and protection against common vulnerabilities such as CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and session fixation attacks. As part of its modernization, Spring Security 6 has deprecated older configurations like `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`, promoting a more component-based approach using `SecurityFilterChain` for configuring security settings.

### Key Features of Spring Security 6
- **Component-Based Configuration**: Transition from extending `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` to defining security configurations via `SecurityFilterChain`.
- **Enhanced Request Matching**: Replacement of deprecated matchers (e.g., `AntMatcher`, `MvcMatcher`) with `requestMatchers` for improved path-based access control.
- **Password Management**: Introduction of the `DelegatingPasswordEncoder` for better password storage practices.

## Implementing JWT with Spring Security 6

Integrating JWT (JSON Web Token) with Spring Security 6 enhances the authentication and authorization mechanisms in your Spring Boot application. This setup allows for stateless authentication, where the server does not need to store session information.

### Steps to Implement JWT

1. **Add Dependencies**: Ensure your Spring Boot project includes necessary dependencies such as Spring Security, jjwt (for JWT handling), and any other relevant libraries.
  
2. **Create JWT Utility Class**: Develop a utility class to handle the creation and validation of JWT tokens. This class will typically include methods to generate tokens containing user details (username, roles) and expiration time.

   Example:
```java
public class JwtTokenService {
  public String generateToken(String username) {
  // Logic to create JWT token
  }

  public boolean validateToken(String token) {
  // Logic to validate JWT token
  }
}
```


3. **Define Security Configuration**: Set up a security configuration class that uses `SecurityFilterChain`. This configuration should specify which endpoints are secured and how JWT tokens are processed.

Example:
```java

@EnableWebSecurity
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {
  @Bean
  public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    return http.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
      .requestMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
      .anyRequest().authenticated())
      .addFilterBefore(new JwtRequestFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
      .build();
  }
}
```


4. **Implement JwtRequestFilter**: Create a custom filter that intercepts incoming requests to extract and validate the JWT from the Authorization header.

Example:
```java
public class JwtRequestFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {
  @Override
  protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
    // Logic to extract and validate JWT token
    chain.doFilter(request, response);
  }
}
```


5. **Secure Endpoints**: Finally, ensure that sensitive endpoints require valid JWT tokens for access, while allowing unauthenticated access to public endpoints.

### Conclusion

The integration of Spring Security 6 with JWT provides a powerful framework for securing modern web applications. By following the outlined steps, developers can implement robust authentication mechanisms that enhance both security and user experience in their applications.
